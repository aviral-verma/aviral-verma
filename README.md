I'm a **PM who builds** - designing, prototyping, and shipping AI-powered products end-to-end.  

I work where **AI, product, and systems thinking** meet.

I believe the real edge in modern product building isn’t just prototyping fast - it’s designing systems that scale, evolve, and stay reliable under change.  
 
As I wrote in <a href="https://www.aienabledpm.com/p/beyond-prototyping-why-systems-thinking" target="_blank">Beyond Prototyping (Systems Thinking) ↗</a>, sustainable products come from architectures that adapt, reveal bottlenecks early, and stay coherent as complexity grows.

## How I Prototype with AI

I build fully-functional prototypes using tools like **Lovable, Cursor, and Supabase** — the workflow I call the **LoCuS Stack**.  

I wrote about this approach in <a href="https://www.aienabledpm.com/p/ai-prototyping-mastery-for-product" target="_blank">AI Prototyping Mastery (LoCuS Stack) ↗</a>.

## Products I'm Building

A canvas for visual thinking — diagrams, flows, and structured ideas.

### NewsletterLM  
A writing workspace where you can drop content anytime — images, PDFs, links — and AI makes it instantly usable when you write.

### Personal Finance AI  
An AI-first personal finance prototype that unifies accounts, reveals spending patterns, and lets you explore your money through a Finance Copilot — built to reimagine how personal finance should work.
